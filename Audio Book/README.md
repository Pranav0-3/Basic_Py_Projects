# Audio Book Using Python

An audiobook is a recording or voiceover of a book or other work read aloud. You can listen to audiobooks on any smartphone, tablet, computer, home speaker system, or in-car entertainment system.
It converts PDF text to voice :)


# IMP libraries
 Here we need to use two libraries **pyttsx3** and **PyPDF2** to create an audiobook with Python
 
 - Both the above libraries can be easily installed by using the pip command.
  
      pip install PyPDF2
      
      pip install pyttsx
