Therefore, 'brown' counts as one word, but 'accounted' counts as two. The benefits of a standardized measurement of input speed are that it enables comparison across language and hardware boundaries.

Some use their fingers very consistently, with the same finger being used to type the same character every time, while others vary the way they use their fingers.\",\n",
